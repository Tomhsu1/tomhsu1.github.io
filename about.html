    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Hi, I am Tom Hsu, a reliable and ambitious coder/programmer at Saint Ignatius College Preparatory, who is looking to write clear and concise code for your team. Since I was part of different programs, such as Dev Mission, Mission Bit, and more, and spent countless hours of practice to further my skills and knowledge, I was able to code a game using HTML and JavaScript where the player has to shoot down the enemy. Throughout the process of creating this game, I encountered multiple setbacks and obstacles, but I was determined to persevere and persist past the hardships in order to meet the time deadline, showing that I am a dedicated worker and able to finish tasks in a timely manner. I recognized that coding is a huge passion of mine and I am hoping to pursue an internship or job in the technology industry. </p>
